        Sometimes it's helpful to ensure a function runs only once during the
        lifecycle of the website, e.g. for setting up logging, initializing an
        environment, etc.
      </p>

      <p>
        Implement a function that accepts a callback and restricts its
        invocation to at most once. Subsequent calls of the function will return
        the result of the first invocation of the callback function. The
        callback function is invoked with the this binding and arguments of the
        created function.
      </p>
      <h2>Examples</h2>
      <code>
        let i = 1; <br>
        function incrementBy(value) { <br> 
          i += value; return i; <br>
        }<br>
        const incrementByOnce = once(incrementBy);<br>
        incrementByOnce(2); // i is now 3; The function returns 3. <br>
        incrementByOnce(3); // i is still 3; The function returns the result of the first invocation, which is 3.<br>
        i = 4; <br>
        incrementByOnce(2); // i is still 4 as it is not modified. The function returns the result of the first invocation, which is 3. <br>
